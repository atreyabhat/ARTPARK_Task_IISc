# ARTPARK_Task_IISc

Autonomous navigating robot with a 7 ray lidar, 90 deg FoV

ROS Melodic, TurtleBot3 Simulation

No mapping is done, and the velocities can be tuned to suit different environments and required aggressivness 

Limitations : Cannot detect an obstacle if less than a FoV of 13 degrees due to the 7 ray lidar implementation

Task given by IISc Artpark during the Internship Selection Process
